\section{Errors in the Paper}
\label{error}

In this section we list some suspected errors in the paper.

\paragraph{Error 1.}
In Equation (6) of page 3 of the paper, the potential after the synaptic current are computed as
\begin{equation}
	\theta_j^+ = \theta(t_j^+) = \theta_j^- + \alpha w_j (1+\cos \theta_j^-)
\end{equation}
Firstly, we think it should be 
\begin{equation}
	\theta_j^+ = \theta(t_j^+) = \theta_j^- + (1-\cos \theta_j^-) + \alpha (I_0 + w_j) (1+\cos \theta_j^-)
\end{equation}
There is a bias term $ 1-\cos \theta_j^- +  \alpha I_0 (1+\cos \theta_j^-)$ removed. Initially, $\theta$ is set to $\theta_0^+$, in which case the bias term equals zero. However, when time goes on, more input Dirac current comes in, resulting in the bias term no longer ignorable. Though this error is got rid of by calculating derivative of $\theta$,  we still would like to correct it here.

Precisely, we should use the following formula to update $\theta$:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\theta_j^+ &=& \theta(t_j^+) \\
	&=& \theta_j^- + d\theta \\
	&=& \theta_j^- + \frac{d\theta}{dt} dt\\
	&=& \theta_j^- + ((1-\cos \theta_j^-) +  \alpha I_0 (1+\cos \theta_j^-)\\
	 &&+ \alpha w_j (1+\cos \theta_j^-))dt
\end{eqnarray}


\paragraph{Error 2.} 
In Equation (11) of page 4 of the paper, one condition brach is
\begin{equation}
	\textrm{if } 0 < -\frac{\partial t_s}{\partial w_i} < C,
	\textrm{ then: } \Delta w_i = -2\eta(t_s - \bar{t_s}) \frac{\partial t_s}{\partial w_i}
\end{equation}
We think the condition should be $\textrm{if } 0 \leq -\frac{\partial t_s}{\partial w_i} < C$.
Intuitively, if we have reached the global optimal point, where $\frac{\partial t_s}{\partial w_i} = 0$ for all $w_i$s,
we should be happy with the current weight matrix
instead of adding a large bias ($\eta(t_s - \bar{t_s}) C$) to the weights $w_i$s.
The first ``$<$'' in the condition makes the gradient descent algorithm unstable near the optimal points.

\paragraph{Error 3.} 
In the second paragraph of Section 3 of the paper, the author wrote:
``The learning rule updates the feedback connections $(w_{ij})_{i\leq n,j\leq m}$ from $Y$ to $X$...''
Obviously there is a typo. It should be ``from $Y$ to $X'$'' instead of ``from $Y$ to $X$''.

\paragraph{Error 4.}
There is a small typo in the last paragraph of Section 2.3. 
It should be ``to the case $\theta_i^+ \in [\theta_0^-, \theta_0^+]$'' instead of 
``to the case $\theta_i^+ \in [\theta_0^-\theta_0^+[$''.
