%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
In biological neurons, the timing of a spike depends on the timing of synaptic currents,
in a way that is classically described by the Phase Response Curve. 
This has implications for temporal coding: an action potential that arrives on a synapse has an implicit meaning, 
that depends on the position of the postsynaptic neuron on the firing cycle. 
Previous researchers have shown that this implicit code can be used to perform computations. 
Using theta neurons, they derive a spike-timing dependent learning rule from an error criterion. 
They demonstrate how to train an auto-encoder neural network using this rule.
In this work we review their research, redo the simulations and experiments, compare the results with the
original work, and discuss the strength and weakness of the work in detail.
